## InnerSource Trainings
The mission of the InnerSource Office is to advance in the understanding and adoption of more transparent and collaborative ways of producing software within ONE Europe initiative.
This implies a movement into new ways of working that includes a cultural change, process improvements, and even new tools to learn and use in some cases.


### Scope

There are three main levels where the InnerSource Office can help with:
* T&O Level: Generic trainings and use cases to the T&O Europe as a whole. The motivation here is to share general concepts about InnerSource, use cases, and specific technical topics but with a broad perspective.
* Per project training to help advance in specific topic. As members of the office are embedded in some projects, this may help to uncover some pain points where training can deal with. 
* Learning by doing, workshops, and hands-on when needed with specific members and at any level. 
The main topics to cover could be the following ones:
* Cultural Goals:
** Transparency
*** Openness and what this means.
** Collaboration.
*** Open discussions, netiquette.
*** Ticketing systems and Pull Requests.
*** The structure of a good pull request.
** Community.
*** Working in the open.
*** Public talks.
** Meritocracy.
*** The Trusted Committer, role and responsibilities.
* Process Improvement:
** Pull Request.
** Code Review.
** Automated Testing, moving testing to the beginning of the development chain.
* Tooling:
** Using Git.
** Using GitHub.
** Using Jira.

Type of meetings:

* InnerSource 101 sessions: we should provide videos and materials and have them available once and again. We could have recurring sessions, or on demand ones.
* Technical sessions that are related to process steps: code review, pull request, automated testing and other topics are part of this discussion.
* Use cases where Santander people talk about their own experiences, successful actions, and lessons learned.


### Feedback

A continuous way of having feedback and training request would be good to have. This can be treated at different levels:
* Process to let the internal community choose the next training session. This can be done through a ticketing system where people add +1 to any of them.
* Process to let the internal community provide their opinion about the quality of the training and ideas to improve.


### Schedule

* General meetings: 1 per month with high level topics as introduction to InnerSource, explaining the ideal world.
* Project level meetings: 1 per month. Marketing actions related to the existence of the InnerSource project. This could be seen as the featured InnerSource project of the month. We can use this with two goals: bring others to the meeting and give the podium, and create awareness about the initiative.
* Ad-hoc training meetings: these are the ones we see are required by the projects to fill missing knowledge gaps.
